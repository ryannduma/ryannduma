## Hello World 👋
My name is Ry. I’m a Beacon Scholar studying Materials Science & Engineering at Imperial College London. 

I build AI systems for materials design.

- 🌍 I currently work and study in London, but I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪
- 🔭 I work on LLMs and cheminformatics tools: [Crystalyse](https://www.crystalyse.ai/) (multi-tool agentic materials design), [Sky](https://github.com/hspark1212/synthesis-agent) (synthesis exploration agent), and [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT) (chemical heuristics and property prediction)
- 📜 I'm reading 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' by Shoshana Zuboff and exploring [Chris Olah's](https://colah.github.io/) interpretability work
- 👯 I'd love to collaborate on:
    - Interpretable AI for scientific applications
    - Agentic AI systems for scientific discovery
    - Materials informatics and computational design
    - Computer vision (especially for lab automation)
    - Robotics projects (for literally anything - i recently made a small arduino system to monitor the moisture level for my dracaena plant lol)
- 🌱 In my spare time I currently binge Attack on Titan (anime) and play Elden Ring! (I know, I'm late to the party)
- 💬 Let's chat about philosophy, running, music, film, and gaming!
- 📝 My writing: [Substack](https://rynduma.substack.com) · [Thinklog](https://rysthinklog.bearblog.dev/)
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email](mailto:napo.nduma22@imperial.ac.uk) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rynduma/) 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his

### that's all for now, live well!
