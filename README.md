## Hello World 👋  
I am a Beacon Scholar studying at Imperial College London, and I currently work at [CuspAI](https://www.cusp.ai/) as an ML intern. 

I was previously a student researcher at [WMD-Group](https://github.com/WMD-group), where I built tools like [Crystalyse](https://www.crystalyse.ai/) (provenance-enforced scientific AI agent for materials design), [Sky](https://github.com/hspark1212/synthesis-agent) (synthesis exploration agent), and contributed to [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT) (chemical heuristics and property prediction toolkit).
