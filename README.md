## Hello World 👋  
I'm Ry — a Beacon Scholar born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪, studying Materials Science & Engineering at Imperial College London.  

My work explores how AI and machine learning can accelerate understanding and discovery in chemistry and materials science. I build tools like [Crystalyse](https://www.crystalyse.ai/) (multi-tool agentic materials design), [Sky](https://github.com/hspark1212/synthesis-agent) (synthesis exploration agent), and [SMACT](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT) (chemical heuristics and property prediction toolkit).  

My work is guided by an interest in the philosophy of science and interpretability, with a focus on how reasoning systems can solve pressing commercial and scientific challenges.

> I am actively exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills to solve impactful problems. I am open to discussing roles in technical research, engineering, and consulting, as well as compelling PhD and Masters programs.

#### *Side Notes*


📜 Currently reading *A Brief History of Intelligence* (Max Bennett) and exploring [Chris Olah’s](https://colah.github.io/) interpretability work.  
👯 Always open to collaborations on interpretability, agentic AI systems, and computational materials design.  
🌱 Outside the lab, I’m catching up on *Attack on Titan* and finally playing *Elden Ring*.
